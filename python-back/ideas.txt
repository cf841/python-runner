Difficult+Interestingness of a puzzle:

Number of cells added to make 'simple' (solve with only constraint-satisfation with NO backtracking)
Amount of backtracking needed (0 is standard, 1 tricky, 2 very hard) <- Need improvement on this metric
Amount of unique techniques used to solve (ie how many steps of human logic to make reductions total in the puzzle)


Rules that can be added:

Odd/Even cells
Two cells must be/must not be consecutive
Palindrome lines, thermal bulb (Linked list, only need to store head and maybe for convenience tail, maybe last/first unfound node)
killer cage -> annoying for CSP, collection of cells with a total. 

Puzzle:
    => Grid
        => Cells
    => Restriction type + locations

CSP/Checker must check for all normal grid rules then all restrictions. Seperating should make it easier to implement
